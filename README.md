Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/NN9r9b62G - I dublicated my sketch from A1Q1, and moved all my code into five different functions. Each function was dedicated to a specific row of the sketch, and contained their respective filled squares that come together to make my G.

Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/JvCST-zQN - Using the beginShape() method, I created the letter G with 12 different points. I filled the letter in with a color and changed its stroke color too.

Question 3: https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/tGT4zUsmS - I dulpicated my preivous sketch and moved the code making up the G into a new function. Using variables (x,y,size) I changed the size and posotion of the shape.

Question 4: https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/ksBhwwBrh - First I changed the canvas size to be 600x400. After, I created functions for every shape set in my flag, all parts of the original flags I had chosen (Georgia, Bahamas, Eritrea). The function with the mose use was the addCross function, which added 6 crosses that I was able to position as I pleased because of the variables. I created those a single cross with the drawShape() method. The colors were picked from each shapes respective flag, and tweaked to match a better color theme.
